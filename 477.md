# EE477 Final Project

*Team:* Gus Smith, Logan Weber

We have chosen to optimize the branch predictor.
Specifically, we will be upgrading the branch predictor from a simple 2-bit BP to a more advanced BP, yet to be chosen.
We are currently researching which branch predictors we feel we can implement in the time remaining.

# Phase 3 Before-and-After

With global simple branch predictor.
```
        clk   :                  235
        instr :                   70
        fe_nop:                    0
        be_nop:                    0
        me_nop:                    0
        poison:                  122
        roll  :                   24
        mIPC  :                  297
