# EE477 Final Project

*Team:* Gus Smith, Logan Weber

We have chosen to optimize the branch predictor.
Specifically, we will be upgrading the branch predictor from a simple 2-bit BP to a more advanced BP, yet to be chosen.
We are currently researching which branch predictors we feel we can implement in the time remaining.

Schematics are in our project notebook.
